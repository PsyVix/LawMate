        <h2>The Supreme Court dismisses Manish Sisodia's curative petition for bail in the Delhi Excise Policy scam</h2>
        <p>Supreme Court Denies Manish Sisodia's Bail Petition in Delhi Excise Policy Scam, Rejects Open Court Hearing Request.</p>

                    <img class="im" src="F/N1.jpg">
                    The Supreme Court has dismissed the curative petition filed by Manish Sisodia, seeking bail in the Delhi Excise Policy scam, and also rejected his request 
        for an open court hearing. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister's appeal against the apex court's denial of bail in the money laundering case linked to the scam 
        has been turned down by a bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, and SVN Bhatti. The court ruled that there were no grounds for review, citing 
        the decision in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra. <br><br>
        Sisodia's earlier review plea was also dismissed by the court. Sisodia had filed the curative petition after the top court's December 14 order denied 
        him bail in the money laundering case associated with the Delhi excise policy scam. The court, in its October 30 decision denying bail, highlighted certain doubtful aspects regarding the transfer of 
        ₹338 crore, which led to the rejection of bail.<br><br>
         Sisodia has been incarcerated since February 26 and is under investigation by both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement 
        Directorate (ED). The scam alleges collusion among Delhi government officials to grant liquor licenses to specific traders in exchange for bribes, with officials purportedly manipulating the excise 
        policy to favor certain liquor vendors. Despite Sisodia's unsuccessful attempts to secure bail, the Delhi High Court had previously denied him relief in cases brought against him by both central 
        agencies, prompting him to seek recourse from the Supreme Court.<br><br>

                            <img class="im" src="F/N2.jpg">The Election Commission of India (ECI) has published electoral bonds data on its website following the submission of all encashed electoral bond details 
        by the State Bank of India (SBI) on March 12. A press release from the ECI stated that in compliance with the directives of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, as outlined in its orders dated February 15 and 
        March 11, 2024 (pertaining to WPC NO.880 of 2017), SBI provided the electoral bonds data to the ECI on March 12, 2024. 
        <br><br>The ECI has uploaded this data on its website, as received from SBI, on an "as

        parties  receiving contributions via electoral bonds from April 12, 2019. The Court mandated SBI to provide particulars of each electoral bond purchased, purchaser's name, bond denomination, and 
        details of bonds redeemed by political parties, including encashment dates, to the ECI by March 6. 
        <br><br>SBI sought an extension of the deadline until June 30, but the Supreme Court dismissed this 
        request onMarch 11, directing SBI to supply the details to the ECI by March 12. On March 13, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara informed the Supreme Court, through an affidavit, that the bank had 
        complied with  the court's directive by submitting electoral bonds information to the ECI by March 12.<br><br>

        <h2>Gauhati High Court deems SIM swapping a significant threat after an Airtel customer loses more than 8 lakh rupees to bank fraud.</h2>
        <p>The Court inquired of the Central government whether Airtel had contravened guidelines concerning the issuance of duplicate SIM cards.</p>
        <p class="read-more">Read more</p>
        <p class="full-story" style="display: none;">
                            <img class="im" src="F/N3.avif">
        Recently, the Gauhati High Court expressed concern over the growing threat of SIM swap scams, where fraudsters obtain duplicate SIM cards of customers' numbers, leading to various instances 
        of bank fraud. Justice Devashis Baruah made this observation while directing the Central government to investigate whether Airtel had violated Department of Telecommunications (DoT) 
        instructions on issuing duplicate SIM cards in a case involving a banking fraud against an Airtel customer, Paresh Chandra Deka. <br><br>
        The case involved the fraudulent withdrawal of approximately 
        ₹8,95,040 from the State Bank of India (SBI) account of the petitioner, Paresh Chandra Deka, a pensioner. This withdrawal occurred through at least 12 transactions after fraudsters obtained a 
        duplicate Airtel SIM card linked to Deka's bank account. Referring to a circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2017 regarding customer liability in unauthorized electronic banking 
        transactions, the Court considered that the provision might be applicable to the petitioner's case, where neither the customer nor the bank was at fault. Concerned about the alleged violation of DoT 
        circular by Airtel and recognizing SIM swapping as a significant issue leading to various bank frauds, the Court decided to include the Union of India, represented by the Secretary to the Government 
        of India, Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications, as a party respondent in the proceedings. 
        <br><br>
        The Court requested the Central government to provide insight into whether 
        Airtel had violated instructions when issuing a duplicate SIM card to a fraudster. The petitioner lost the funds to fraudulent transactions in 2020, leading to the arrest of five individuals by the police. 
        Notably, the petitioner had never applied for internet banking, and the fraudulent transactions occurred when the original SIM card linked to the bank account was not operational. The Court 
        examined the discrepancies between the documents submitted by the fraudster and the petitioner and questioned how Airtel's employee could have declared satisfaction with the document 
        matching process when the details did not align. Considering these issues, the Court made the Central government a party to the case and scheduled further consideration for April 2. Advocate R 
        Dhar represented the petitioner in the case.<br><br>

        <h2>The Supreme Court's Constitution Bench is currently deliberating on whether the royalty paid by mining operators constitutes a tax.</h2>
        <p>This case stands as the oldest pending 9-judge bench matter before the apex court.</p>
        <p class="read-more">Read more</p>
        <p class="full-story" style="display: none;">
                            <img class="im" src="F/N4.jpg">The Supreme Court has reserved its verdict in the case concerning whether royalty paid by mining operators to the Central government constitutes a tax. This case, identified as Mineral Area Development Authority etc vs Steel Authority of India and ors, is the oldest pending 9-judge bench matter before the apex court. The bench, comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud along with Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Abhay S Oka, BV Nagarathna, JB Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Ujjal Bhuyan, Satish Chandra Sharma, and Augustine George Masih, concluded hearing arguments from all parties on the ninth day of proceedings. 
        <br><br>The case also involves deliberation on whether State governments are deprived of powers to tax and regulate mines and minerals due to the enactment of the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act (Mines Act). Previously, in 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in India Cement Ltd v State of Tamil Nadu that royalty constitutes 'tax' under the Mines Act, and cesses on royalty were beyond the legislative competence of States. In February 1995, the Court upheld Section 9 of the Mines Act in State of Madhya Pradesh v Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd, reaffirming the 1989 decision. 
        <br><br>However, in January 2004, a five-judge bench in State of West Bengal v Kesoram Industries Ltd, by a 3:2 majority, clarified that the 1989 decision only meant to say that cess on royalty is a tax, not royalty itself. In March 2011, another three-judge bench recognized a "prima facie" conflict between the decisions in India Cements and Kesoram Industries, prompting the current reference. The Central government argued that States cannot levy taxes on mineral-bearing lands and that royalties collected by the Central government eventually benefit the States. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta emphasized the need for national-level uniformity in mineral industry development to ensure systematic utilization of minerals in the public interest..</p>
